# Staff Playbook

Staff own **execution**: completing tasks, supporting clients, and keeping the system up to date.

## Daily checklist

- Check **My Tasks** and clear urgent/overdue items first
- Update task statuses (todo → in_progress → review → completed)
- Keep client notes current (what happened, what’s next, blockers)
- Respond to assigned support tickets within SLA
- Prepare content items for approval (complete drafts + assets + metadata)

## How to use the system well

- **If it’s not in MarketingOS, it didn’t happen**
  - Put the latest status in tasks, tickets, and client notes.
- **Use clear statuses**
  - Avoid “silent progress”; move tasks to `in_progress` and leave a comment when blocked.
- **Prefer checklists**
  - If a task has 3+ steps, add checklist items so handoffs are clean.

## What you can access (high level)

Staff can generally manage:

- Clients, campaigns, leads, content, tickets (but not user management or system settings)

# Creator Playbook

Creators deliver the on-the-ground content that powers client results.

## Before you can work

- Submit creator application (public signup flow)
- Verify your email (recommended/required depending on enforcement)
- Wait for application review (pending → accepted/declined)

If you’re pending or declined you will not be able to fully log in to creator tools.

## Your responsibilities

- Keep your **availability** updated
- Show up to scheduled visits on time
- Upload deliverables quickly and clearly (use the requested format)
- Respond to revision requests
- Keep your payout info current

## Visits (how it works)

Typical lifecycle:

- scheduled → completed → upload submitted → reviewed → approved (or revision requested) → payment released

## Upload standards (minimum)

- Provide links that your team can access reliably (no broken permissions)
- Include a short note for each deliverable: what it is + where it should be used
- If a deliverable has restrictions (music/license/model release), state it clearly

## Payouts

- Keep payout method/details up to date in your profile settings.
- Payments are released after approval; if you have questions, open a support ticket with:
  - visit id
  - date/time
  - upload links
  - any revision notes

## Support

- Creators can use tickets for support issues (account, scheduling, payout questions).

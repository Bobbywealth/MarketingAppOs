# Manager Playbook

Managers own **delivery quality**, **team throughput**, and **client outcomes**.

## What you’re responsible for

- Keeping client work unblocked (tasks, approvals, content, visits)
- Keeping delivery aligned to scope (packages, goals, timelines)
- Escalations: tickets, billing risk, overdue deliverables

## Daily checklist

- **Tasks**
  - Review urgent + overdue tasks
  - Reassign blocked items and clarify acceptance criteria
- **Clients**
  - Review at-risk clients (no recent activity, overdue deliverables)
- **Content**
  - Review pending content approvals (approve / request revision)
- **Creators & visits**
  - Approve completed visits (quality score + notes)
  - Request revisions when needed
- **Support**
  - Review open tickets and ensure assignment + response

## Key workflows you run

- **Client onboarding / handoff**
  - Ensure the client record is complete (contacts, package, assignments, start date)
  - Confirm onboarding tasks are created and scheduled
- **Content pipeline**
  - Ensure each content post has:
    - Clear title
    - Copy/content
    - Platforms
    - Scheduled date (if applicable)
    - Approval status correctly set
- **Creator fulfillment**
  - For each visit:
    - scheduled → completed → upload received → approved (or revision requested)
  - Log quality details consistently so creators can improve

## What you can access (high level)

Managers can generally manage:

- Clients, campaigns, leads, content, invoices, tickets, reports

See full matrix: [`02-roles-and-permissions.md`](../02-roles-and-permissions.md)

## Common escalations

- **Client complaint / urgent ticket**
  - Acknowledge within SLA
  - Assign an owner and post an internal note
  - If the issue touches billing or access control, escalate to Admin
- **Creator dispute**
  - Document facts (dates, uploads, quality notes)
  - Escalate payouts/disputes as needed

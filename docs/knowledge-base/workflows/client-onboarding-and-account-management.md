# Workflow: Client Onboarding + Account Management

**Owner roles**: Manager (primary), Staff (execution), Admin (billing/access)

## Goal

Turn a signed client into an active, successful account with clear ownership, scope, and deliverables tracked inside MarketingOS.

## Intake / setup (Day 0)

- **Create / confirm the client record**
  - name + company + email/phone
  - website
  - service tags (scope)
  - status (onboarding/active/etc.)
- **Set ownership**
  - sales agent (if applicable)
  - account manager / assigned-to
- **Set package + billing status**
  - package id (subscription package)
  - billing status (current/overdue/paused/cancelled)

## Onboarding tasks

Onboarding tasks should cover:

- access collection (social accounts, ad accounts, website/hosting)
- brand assets (logos, colors, voice)
- KPI definitions and success metrics
- communication cadence

## Ongoing management (weekly rhythm)

- Update client notes (status, wins, risks, next steps)
- Keep tasks current (what’s being delivered this week)
- Track content production and approvals
- Track website projects (if applicable)

## Client documents

Use Client Documents for:

- contracts / SOW
- brand guidelines
- login information references (avoid storing raw passwords in plaintext; use secure systems as policy)
- deliverables and exports

## Website projects (when applicable)

Website Projects track:

- stage (design/dev/qa/launch)
- progress %
- domain + hosting + SSL status and expiry reminders

## Analytics (when applicable)

- Analytics metrics are stored as snapshots by client/campaign/date.
- Social analytics can be connected and refreshed via ScrapeCreators (if enabled).

## Definition of done (onboarding complete)

- client record complete and assigned
- access + brand assets collected
- first deliverables scheduled (tasks + content plan)
- first reporting cadence established

# Workflow: Content + Creator Visits (Fulfillment)

**Owner roles**: Manager (quality), Staff (execution), Creator Manager (creator operations), Creator (delivery), Admin (payouts)

## Goal

Deliver consistent content output with clear approvals and accountability.

## Content Posts (content calendar)

### Typical lifecycle

- draft → pending → approved / rejected → published

### Minimum standard for a “ready for approval” post

- title is clear and client-specific
- platforms selected
- copy/content complete
- media links attached (if applicable)
- scheduled date set (when required)
- notes include any constraints or special instructions

### Approvals

- Approve only when it meets brand and platform requirements.
- If rejecting/requesting revision, include actionable feedback:
  - what to change
  - examples (if possible)
  - deadline

## Creators & Visits (field work)

### Creator application flow

- Creator submits public application
- Admin/Creator Manager reviews and accepts/declines
- Accepted creators can log in and use creator tools

### Visit lifecycle (expected)

- scheduled
- completed
- upload submitted (links)
- reviewed/approved (or revision requested)
- payment released (Admin-only)

### Quality review (Manager/Staff)

- Score consistently (so creators can improve)
- If revision requested:
  - state exactly what’s missing or needs correction
  - state when it’s due

### Creator expectations

- keep availability updated
- upload deliverables quickly
- respond to revision requests

## Payouts

- Payout release is a controlled step (Admin-only).
- Only release after approval and any dispute resolution is complete.
